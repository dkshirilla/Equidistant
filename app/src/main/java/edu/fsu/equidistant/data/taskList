TODO:
1. Correct backstack for BottomNavigation. Each Fragment should be "top level." Back shouldn't
return to previous fragments.

2. Send "meetingID" through notification data.

3. Get Location data every ~10 minutes. Notification should also update user's Location.

4. Persistent meetingID unless "Disband" is used.

5. // TODO: May revert BottomNavigationView here (MainActivity) in favor of a regular buttonClick to navigate.

6.
